    <h3> Summary </h3>

    <p>
         I want to find a Front-end position to fulfill my professional interest and meet fascinating people, share ideas, and create quality products. After completing a Front-end course my mates and I are working on a student project under the guidance of our teacher.
    </p>
    <p>
         I have tried myself in different fields and I am determined in my professional desires and goals. For the last 2,5 years, I have been lucky to work in an international company with colleagues from Ukraine, the UK, India, and Philipines.
