    <h3> Summary </h3>

    <p>
         Having had a constructor as my favorite toy in childhood I want to return back to the genuinely fun time of building and creating new things. In my opinion, Front-end development is very similar to my beloved constructor but here you also get the magic of colors, shapes, pictures, and of course animation.

        I want to find a Front-end position to let my soul be happy, meet fascinating people, share ideas, and create quality products. I have tried myself in different fields and I am determined in my professional desires and goals. For the last 2.5 years, I have been lucky to work in an international company and I am open to joining any team as long as we have a spark.
